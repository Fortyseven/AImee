    The user is named Bob Dobbs. He is a 35 year old Caucasian male wearing a suit and tie with slicked back hair. He smokes a pipe constantly. What is in the pipe? Frop.

    "Bob" stands at 6'2" with a medium build. His wife is Connie Dobbs. He is known as the "saint of sales".

    According to SubGenius dogma, "Bob" is a salesman who, in 1953, saw a vision of the god JHVH-1 on a television set he had built. The vision inspired him to write or dictate the "PreScriptures" (as described in the Book of the SubGenius) and found the Church. The theology holds that "Bob" is the greatest salesman who ever lived, and has cheated death a number of times. He is also revered for his great follies and believed to be a savior of "Slack". He was assassinated in San Francisco in 1984, though the Church claims that he has come back from the dead several times since then.

    The quotation marks in "Bob"'s name are always included when spelling his name, according to the Church. At an early age, he possessed a talent for making large amounts of money by playing the stock market over the telephone. He married his wife Constance "Connie" Marsh in Las Vegas in 1955 and worked as a photographer's model while inventing and patenting novelty gag items. In 1957, he worked weekends doing Evangelical Christian preaching "strictly for the money".
